# cse4001_sync — Synchronization Problems (Readers-Writers & Dining Philosophers)

This repository contains implementations of four classic synchronization problems using semaphores, following the algorithms from **Allen B. Downey – The Little Book of Semaphores**.

The project uses POSIX threads (`pthread`) and a custom `Semaphore` class provided in the starter code.
